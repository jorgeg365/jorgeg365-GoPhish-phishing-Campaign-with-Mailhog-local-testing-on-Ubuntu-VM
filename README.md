# jorgeg365-GoPhish-phishing-Campaign-with-Mailhog-local-testing-on-Ubuntu-VM

🧰 Full Setup: GoPhish + MailHog on Ubuntu VM
✅ Prerequisites
Make sure your Ubuntu VM is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install unzip curl wget git -y
```
🧑‍💻 Step 1: Install GoPhish
1. Download the latest GoPhish release

```bash
wget https://github.com/gophish/gophish/releases/download/v0.12.1/gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip
unzip gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip
cd gophish
```
<cd gophish> did not work for me so use this if that's the case 

```bash
chmod +x gophish
```
2. Run GoPhish

```bash
sudo ./gophish
```
