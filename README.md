üß∞ Full Setup: GoPhish + MailHog on Ubuntu VM
‚úÖ Prerequisites

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

unzip gophish-v0.12.1-linux-64bit.zip
cd gophish
```
-cd gophish- did not work for me so use this if that's the case 

```bash
chmod +x gophish
```
2. Run GoPhish

```bash
sudo ./gophish
```
You‚Äôll see output showing:
